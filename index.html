			<p>Although Adeje started out as a small village near the mountains, the tourism boom during the second half of the last century turned its coast into one of Europe's most important holiday destinations. Adeje combines its charm as a little country enclave, full of trails and fascinating natural landscapes, with a range of top notch 4 and 5 star hotels. Theme parks, beaches and leisure options such as whale and dolphin watching make it an all-encompassing holiday resort.</p>

			<p>Adeje is a municipality in southwest Tenerife, one of Spain’s Canary Islands. It’s home to Costa Adeje resort, with Siam Park, a Thai-themed water park, and many beaches, like gray-sand Playa El Duque. Northeast, Adeje town has Santa Úrsula Church, with sgraffito work and a bell gable. The Museum of Sacred Art lies underneath Plaza España square. El Barranco del Infierno is a rugged nature reserve with trails.</p>

			<p>The superb quality beaches of southern Tenerife are among the best in the Canary Islands and boast warm sea temperatures for much of the year. The chic Playa del Duque really is excellent, with golden soft sand and beautiful clear water. Sumptuous sunbeds line the beach and an elegant promenade is alive with good quality restaurants and bars. Playa Fañabé is equally inviting, with a large stretch of sand and ideal conditions for swimming in the ocean. Different varieties of fish can be found at the tranquil cove of Playa Paraiso, which boasts a fantastic 5-star hotel on the seafront.</p>

			<p>There are several choices of water-based activities on almost all of these beaches, such as water skiing, windsurfing, paddle-boarding and scuba diving. If you prefer to have the ground beneath your feet and to have fun in swimming pools and on rides, then Aqualand Costa Adeje (formerly known as Octopus) is the ideal place to spend part of the day. It is without a doubt one of the best family oriented water parks on the island, and also runs a spectacular dolphin show. If you would prefer something more relaxed, then Aqua Club Termal is one of the largest thermal clubs in the Canary Islands. There is also Golf Costa Adeje, which is one of the Canary Islands' best golf courses and is only 5km outside of the centre of Costa Adeje.</p>
